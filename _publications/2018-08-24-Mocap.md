collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-08-24-Mocap
excerpt: 'Motion capture system serves as a critical technology in a wide range of applications. Nowadays, motion capture system based on inter components has become a new research hotspot. This paper provides a new design of low cost wearable wireless inertia measurement unit based on a 9-DOF micro inertia sensor MPU9250 and STM32F103C8T6 MCU. Furthermore, an ultra-low power (ULP) 2Mbps RF transceiver IC NRF24L01 was used as RF transceiver, which operates in 2.4GHz ISM (Industrial, Scientific and Medical) band, with peak RX/TX currents lower than 14mA. Finally, a program was built by Unity3D 5.6 on PC to display sensors real-time attitude and the experiment shows it has good performance in static and dynamic state.'

excerpt: 'The real-time gait phase of human lower extremity is the foundation for wearable robots to provide precise and complex assistance strategies in human-robot interaction. In addition to strengths in estimation performance, it is crucial to make the devices portable and user-friendly that can drive the adoption in the unstructured environments. In this paper, we present an online continuous gait phase estimation system based on multi-source flexible sensors that address this issue. Specifically, we utilize two soft bend sensors mounted around the hip joint and a set of flexible pressure sensors mounted on the bottom of the foot to track the real-time motion of the lower limbs. The adaptive nonlinear frequency oscillators (ANFOs) are used to couple with the captured motion to generate a sequential, linearly growing gait phase. Moreover, heel strike events are detected to calculate phase shift and synchronize the phase with practical action. A uniform walking experiment validates the performance of the proposed method. The experiment results demonstrate that our approach could provide accurate gait phase information and has the potential to improve the interaction transparency of exoskeleton robots in the future.'

Motion capture system serves as a critical technology in a wide range of applications. Nowadays, motion capture system based on inter components has become a new research hotspot. This paper provides a new design of low cost wearable wireless inertia measurement unit based on a 9-DOF micro inertia sensor MPU9250 and STM32F103C8T6 MCU. Furthermore, an ultra-low power (ULP) 2Mbps RF transceiver IC NRF24L01 was used as RF transceiver, which operates in 2.4GHz ISM (Industrial, Scientific and Medical) band, with peak RX/TX currents lower than 14mA. Finally, a program was built by Unity3D 5.6 on PC to display sensors real-time attitude and the experiment shows it has good performance in static and dynamic state.

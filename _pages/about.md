I am currently pursuing my PhD in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) under the supervision of Professor Quanjun Song. Additionally, I am leading the development of several new assistive devices at the Research Center for Intelligent Sensing Technology, which is part of the Hefei Institute of Intelligent Machinery (IIM) at the Hefei Institute of Physical Sciences, CAS. These devices include exoskeleton robots for gait symmetry rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients, non-invasive human-computer interaction interfaces, and inertial motion capture systems, among others.

* **Soft Body-Machine Interface**

Spinal cord injury-induced tetraplegia significantly impairs a patient's ability to carry out daily activities. Customized and efficient human-machine interfaces for controlling assistive devices play an important role in improving the patient's self-help ability and reducing the societal caregiving burden. 

In this project, we developed a body-machine interface that utilizes soft sensors and IMUs to remap residual shoulder movements of tetraplegics to a two-dimensional continuous command space. Our proposed method has the potential to be integrated into clothing, enabling non-invasive interaction in daily life. Additionally, in the future, it can also serve as a supplement for completing more intricate tasks through collaboration with brain-computer interface. 

* **Gait symmetry rehabilitation exoskeleton robot** 

Hemiplegia is a loss of motor and sensory function in one side of the body due to neurological disorders such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, and spinal cord injury. It usually manifests as muscle weakness, motor impairment, sensory impairment, speech impairment and other symptoms, with lower limb motor impairment being the most common. 

In this project, we developed a gait learning algorithm framework that can map the lower extremity motion of the unaffected side of the patient to the affected side and designed a motor-driven active knee orthosis.
